# Udemy Space Shooter
This is just my source control repo for the Udemy class I'm taking on Unity.

We're building a 2.5d space shooter in [https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-game-development-with-unity/]

- This is the GalaxyShooter project created during Jonathan Weinberger's Udemy course: The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity 2019
- I have made additions to the base game and expanded on the mechanics beyond what was in the course.
- Additionally, I _did not_ implement the Co-Op / Multiplayer mode.
- Addition features:
  - Enemies grow in strength and power
  - Boss enemies appear
  - Asteroid (level gates) move and interact with objects
  - Enemy sounds are non-default
  - Added multiple backgrounds
- Asset list:
  - Base assets from The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity 2019 course
  - Additional backgrounds from DinV Studio's "Dynamic Space Background Lite" asset pack
  - Enemy weapon sounds from Eric Berzins' "Ultra SF Game Audio Weapons Pack v.1" asset pack
  - Font and UI panels / buttosn from Unity Technologies' "Unity Samples: UI" asset pack
